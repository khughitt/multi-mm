## Combined Pathway Weights

Combine evidence from multiple datasets in a single pathway-level score.

```{r results = 'asis', fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6}
# create a dataframe with combined pathway weights
pathway_pvals <- pathway_weights %>%
  select(ends_with('pval'))

# count number of missing values per pathway
num_missing <- apply(pathway_pvals, 1, function(x) { sum(is.na(x)) })
num_measurements <- ncol(pathway_pvals) - num_missing

# compute -log10 of the median p-values for each pathway
median_pvals <- apply(pathway_pvals, 1, function(x) {
  x <- x[!is.na(x)]
  -log10(median(pmax(x, MIN_PVAL)))
})

# create a dataframe to store combined pathway scores
pathway_scores <- tibble(
  collection = pathway_weights$collection,
  gene_set = pathway_weights$gene_set,
  score = median_pvals,
  num_measurements,
  num_missing
)

pathway_scores <- pathway_scores %>%
  arrange(desc(score))

ggplot(pathway_scores, aes(x = score)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5)

# pathway data is mostly complete
table(pathway_scores$num_missing) 

# store pathway scores
write_csv(pathway_scores, file.path(output_dir, 'combined', 'pathway_weights.csv'))
```

### Top pathways

#### All

```{r top_pathway_scores, results = 'asis'}
pathway_scores %>% 
  head(20) %>%
  kable
```

#### Filtered, >= 50% non-missing

```{r top_pathway_scores, results = 'asis'}
pathway_scores %>% 
  filter(num_measurements >= (0.50 * ncol(pathway_pvals))) %>%
  head(20) %>%
  kable
```

#### Filtered, >= 75% non-missing

```{r top_pathway_scores, results = 'asis'}
pathway_scores %>% 
  filter(num_measurements >= (0.75 * ncol(pathway_pvals))) %>%
  head(20) %>%
  kable
```
